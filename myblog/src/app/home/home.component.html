      <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2021 by <a href="#" class="text-success text-decoration-underline">IKRAM</a></p>
      <img class="bd-placeholder-img" src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/12/juice-cleanse-plastic-bottles.jpg?quality=82&strip=1" width="800px" height="500px" alt="..." >                 
       <br> <br>
      <p>First thing's first: Juice cleansing is a "detox" diet that can last from a few days to several weeks in which 
        a person consumes only fruit and vegetable juices to obtain nutrition while otherwise abstaining from eating food
        . Many people swear by cleanses and report an improvement to their health, mood, and appearance. The scientific 
        community, however, is less than enthusiastic about juice cleanses—many scientists, dietitians, and doctors regard
         detox diets as less effective than fasting with water, and, therefore, a waste of money. That said, if you're going
          to do one anyway, we recommend consulting with your doctor—or at the very least going along with an "official" juice 
          cleanse program. Simply drinking any ol' juice from anywhere around town is not a good idea.</p>

     <p>it may not have miraculous detoxifying properties, it can be a refreshing and healthy addition to your daily routine. Here are some reasons why detox water can be beneficial:</p>

       <p> Hydration: Staying hydrated is essential for overall health, and detox water can make it more enjoyable. By infusing water with fruits, herbs, or vegetables, it adds a subtle flavor that can encourage you to drink more water throughout the day.</p>
        
       <p> Nutrient Boost: Adding fruits, vegetables, and herbs to your detox water can infuse it with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. For example, adding lemon or cucumber can provide vitamin C and hydration, while mint leaves can add a refreshing flavor and potentially aid digestion.</p>
